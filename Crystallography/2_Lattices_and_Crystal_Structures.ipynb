    "Lattices are a mathematical concept that is created by gathering all the permutations of basis vectors. One can look at a lattice as a tiling of some object. Lattices can exist in one, two, or three dimensions. To represent a lattice in n dimensions one needs n basis vectors. The basis vectors are often referred to as translational vectors. Lattices in 1D, 2D, and 3D are called line, plane, and, space lattices respectively. The following figures show a line lattice and a plane lattice represented by basis vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}(\\vec{b}\\nparallel\\vec{a})$."

    "Now that we have defined the reciprocal space, we can introduce the very useful concept of Miller indices. A plane can be used by the vector perpendicular to it. So we can use the reciprocal lattice vectors to define every plane possible in the lattice. In other words, the reciprocal vectors are used to define the planes in the real space.  The reason we have used a reciprocal lattice vector is that the real space lattice vectors can not be used to define all the planes in the real space. \n",

    "A lattice is the best mathematical object to define a crystal structure. A crystal structure is created by combining a basis with a lattice. This means that the basis will be repeated in all of the points defining the lattice, creating periodic entities of the basis. In solid-state physics, we can use this concept to represent crystal structures. Using a suitable basis and lattice, we represent most of the crystal structures known to us. \n",
